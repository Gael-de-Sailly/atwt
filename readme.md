A Tome With Trials
==================

A Tome With Trials is a `game` for Minetest, and a very special one,
at that.

Prologue
========

*The land is lush with greens, the brown soil of the fields makes the
grass shoot up knee high. It would be easy enough to live off the
fruit and leave this landscape untouched, forever keeping it's beauty
intact. But, you know you'd get settled eventually in a favorite spot
in this Valhalla, this Eldorado, and do more than just sleep under the
stars at night. Perhaps it's that nice cove overlooking the sunsets
over the water, or the viewpoint upon the ridge back east that has
the winter muttons grazing.*

*No, this landscape demands a keeper. Someone who doesn't just take,
but leaves a small but recognizable footprint. As friends come and go,
they'll speak of this place with fondness, even years from now. Yes,
it's a good day to get a head start before the sun stands high in
the sky. Food. Wood. Dirt. Stone. That's how this place will be raised.*

*You reckon, know even, that you'll have to get stock. The traders
aren't anywhere near, and it's not the season to make the long trails
without a large cache of food. Not that it's dangerous to go out. As
long as you stay afar from any of the caves, but you suspect that
the caves may be useful to get to metal ores. You've heard stories
about folk getting lost in caves searching for ores.*

*Then again, it's easier to go down the caves than up to the cloud
rocks. You didn't believe the stories at first. It makes no sense
anyway, rock mountains in the sky? But then, that one time, as you
were gazing at the clouds in the warm summer fields, surrounded by
the swaying wildflowers. It readily startled you, for sure. I mean,
you've had a mutton lick you awake once when you dozed off, but this
was a thundering thump! As you sat up to see what happened, you could
see the brown dust cloud starting to settle just a few paces away. It
was quite the sight, I mean, it left a small crater! Unsettling
for sure. Of course, it was a very moist and tender lamb roast that
evening, but you didn't tell any one of the event. Needless to say
there was no other logical explanation that the poor mutton ihad
fallen from a sky rock.*

*Umpf. Enough day dreaming. First, let us get some breakfast, and
then start construction of our abode!*


Anatomy of A Tome With Trials
=============================

A Tome With Trials is a story addition to the open sandbox world that
minetest creates. The story is not open ended, there is a deliberate
end game scenario, but the world remains open ended as such. The
player can choose to progress through the story elements, or play
the game in the traditional sense.

The story presents itself as a collection of books, each progressively
offering the player hints. Some of these books contain simple stories,
songs or even shopping lists, but there are some that speak of dangers,
describe far places and magic like powers. As the player explores,
they gradually uncover more knowledge of the world around them, and
expose themselves to greater danger. This makes the game extremely
suitable for both beginner players and experienced players.

The end game encompasses an entire world changing event that
permanently changes the world to a much more dangerous place,
challenging the experienced player and offering a lasting experience
to the player.

A Tome With Trials is meant to be played alone. It is not intended
nor suitable for unmoderated multiplayer gameplay, and as such, it
contains elements and code that would likely not be performing well in
a remote network situation. LAN gameplay, at best, should be possible.

ATWT, for short, is not compatible with minetest_game, nor is it
compatible with minetest mods that depend on features in minetest_game.
This is intentional: While mods in general are easy to make compatible,
the ATWT game is intentionally balanced to provide an increasingly
difficult environment, and adding mods that add items and nodes to
the game would drastically change that balance.

For the very same reason, ATWT isn't compatible with minetest texture
packs. Many of the basic nodes in ATWT are named completely different
than their minetest_game equivalents.
